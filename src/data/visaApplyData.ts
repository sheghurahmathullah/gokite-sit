    question: "UK Family Visa",
    answer:
      "This visa category enables Indian citizens to join eligible family members already living in the UK, such as a spouse, civil partner, fianc√©, child, or, in certain exceptional circumstances, an adult-dependent relative. It facilitates family reunification and establishes a shared life in the UK.\n\nDuration: The initial partner visa is typically granted for 2 years and 9 months. An extension is usually required for another 2 years and 9 months. Once you have finished 5 years on this route, you may be permitted to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). Some routes are shorter, and some are longer.\n\nRequirement: You must have an Indian passport, strong evidence of a real and continuing family relationship with your UK-based family member (for example, marriage certificates, proof of sharing funds and evidence of living together) and show English language skills (normally CEFR A1 level for the first application). Requirements differ depending on the kind of family relationship.",

    id: "faq-4",

Additional requirements may include proof of employment, bank statements, invitation letters, and evidence of ties to India.",
